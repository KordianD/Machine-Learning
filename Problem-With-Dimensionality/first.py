'''We have a hyperball with a radius equal to 1.0 inscribed inside a hypercube with edges length equal to 2.0.
Hyperball in multidimensional space is defined as a set of points whose distance from its centre is no greater
than its radius. We randomly fill the hypercube with evenly distributed points.
What % of those points would be inside the hyperball, and what % outside â€“ in the corners?'''
